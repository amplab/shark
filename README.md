# Shark (Hive on Spark)

Shark is a large-scale data warehouse system for Spark designed to be compatible with
Apache Hive. It can answer Hive QL queries up to 30 times faster than Hive without
modification to the existing data nor queries. Shark supports Hive's query language,
metastore, serialization formats, and user-defined functions.
